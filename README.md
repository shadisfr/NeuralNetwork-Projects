- **Objective**: Predict student performance using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model.
- **Dataset**: Student Performance dataset with demographic, family, and academic information.
- **Tasks**: Data preprocessing, model implementation, training, evaluation, and analysis.

### 2. **Medical Appointment No-Shows**
- **Objective**: Predict patient no-shows for medical appointments.
- **Dataset**: Medical Appointment No Shows dataset with features like patient age, appointment details, and reminder status.
- **Tasks**: Data preprocessing, MLP model implementation, literature review, experimentation with activation functions, and evaluation.

### 3. **Architectural Heritage Elements Image64**
- **Objective**: Classify images of architectural heritage elements using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Dataset**: Image dataset with categories like Altar, Column, Dome, and more.
- **Tasks**: Data preprocessing, CNN model building and training, evaluation, and optimization.

### 4. **Autoencoder Reconstruction of Mixed MNIST and CIFAR-10 Images**
- **Objective**: Develop an autoencoder for reconstructing images from MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
- **Dataset**: MNIST (handwritten digits) and CIFAR-10 (colored images) datasets.
- **Tasks**: Dataset preparation, autoencoder model construction, training, and evaluation of reconstructions.

### 5. **Training a RL Agent in BipedalWalker-v3**
