Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset

Introduction:
The Medical Appointment No Shows dataset comprises data about medical
appointments and whether patients attended their appointments. This dataset presents
an excellent opportunity for students to apply their knowledge of artificial neural
networks (ANNs), focusing on implementing multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models using
PyTorch. Additionally, students will explore model architectures and other techniques
through literature review to enhance their results.

Dataset Description:
The dataset includes various features such as patient age, gender, appointment date
and time, scheduled date and time, neighborhood, scholarship status, and whether the
patient received an SMS reminder. The target variable indicates whether the patient
showed up for the appointment (1 for 'showed up' and 0 for 'no-show').

Tasks:

Data Preprocessing
● Handle missing values: Develop strategies for dealing with missing values,
either through imputation or removal.
● Explore imbalance: Visualize class distribution to understand the extent of
class imbalance.
Implementation of MLP Model using PyTorch
● Implement an MLP model using PyTorch, considering relevant libraries
and functions.
● Research model architectures: Explore existing literature to understand
various model architectures used in MLPs.

Literature Review on Model Architectures and Techniques
● Read papers on different model architectures used in MLPs, such as deep
MLPs, wide and deep networks, or attention mechanisms.
● Investigate techniques to enhance model performance, including
advanced activation functions, initialization methods, and regularization
techniques.
Experimentation with Activation Functions and Optimizers
● Experiment with different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)
and optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD) to observe their impact on model
performance.
● Implement these variations in the MLP model and evaluate their
convergence speed and accuracy.
Regularization Techniques and Hyperparameter Tuning
● Implement dropout and L2 regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
● Perform hyperparameter tuning to find optimal values for learning rate,
batch size, and other parameters, utilizing techniques like grid search or
random search.
Model Training and Evaluation
● Train the MLP model on the training data and validate it using the
validation set.
● Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score.
● Utilize techniques like cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Visualization and Interpretation
● Visualize the training process of the MLP model, including loss and
accuracy curves over epochs.
● Analyze learned representations by visualizing decision boundaries or
feature importance.
Conclusion and Future Work
● Summarize findings from experiments and draw conclusions about the
effectiveness of different techniques.
● Propose future research directions based on insights gained, including
exploring novel architectures or incorporating additional features for
improved prediction.
