# Architectural Heritage Elements Image64 Dataset

## Introduction

The Architectural Heritage Elements (AHE) Dataset is a collection of images specifically designed for developing deep learning algorithms and techniques in the classification of architectural heritage images. The dataset contains a total of 10,235 images classified into ten categories, each representing different architectural elements.

### Dataset Categories:

- **Altar**: 829 images
- **Apse**: 514 images
- **Bell tower**: 1,059 images
- **Column**: 1,919 images
- **Dome (inner)**: 616 images
- **Dome (outer)**: 1,177 images
- **Flying buttress**: 407 images
- **Gargoyle (and Chimera)**: 1,571 images
- **Stained glass**: 1,033 images
- **Vault**: 1,110 images

## Objective

The objectives of this project are multi-faceted:

1. **CNN Model Training**: 
    - Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Architectural Heritage Elements Image64 Dataset.
    - This includes preprocessing the data, designing the CNN architecture, and training the model using an appropriate optimization algorithm.

2. **Deconvolution Visualization**: 
    - Utilize deconvolution techniques to visualize the features learned by the CNN.
    - Implement deconvolution operations within the CNN and visualize the feature maps to understand how the model interprets the input images and which features are critical for classification.

3. **Image Generation for Specific Classes**: 
    - Manipulate the trained model to generate images corresponding to specific classes within the dataset.


## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Resize the images and normalize the pixel values to prepare the data for the model.
- Additional preprocessing steps might include data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training set.

### 2. Model Building
- Construct a CNN model using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- The architecture should include several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected (dense) layers.

### 3. Training
- Train the CNN model using a portion of the dataset.
- Techniques such as data augmentation and dropout can be employed to improve performance and mitigate overfitting.

### 4. Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance on a separate test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Optimization
- Optimize the model based on evaluation results by tuning hyperparameters and potentially modifying the architecture to enhance performance.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, the following outcomes are anticipated:

- A functional CNN model capable of classifying architectural elements with reasonable accuracy.
- Practical experience in handling image data, building and training CNN models, and applying optimization techniques for improved model performance.
